## 🎯 What is Perinola?

Perinola transforms team dynamics through **rotating responsibilities** and **shared ownership**. Inspired by the Latin American spinning top game, this framework ensures everyone contributes, learns, and leads—creating healthier, more adaptable teams.

### ⚡ The Problem We Solve
- **Role rigidity** that stifles growth
- **Burnout** from unchanging responsibilities  
- **Knowledge silos** that create bottlenecks
- **Passive team members** who never lead
- **Boring standups** and predictable workflows

### 🎲 The Perinola Solution: Six Dynamic Spins

| Spin | What It Means | Impact |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 🤝 **Everyone Puts** | Collaborative sessions | Collective intelligence |
| 🎯 **Take One** | Small focused tasks | Quick wins & momentum |
| 🚀 **Take Two** | Feature ownership | Deep expertise building |
| 💡 **Put One** | Mentoring & support | Knowledge sharing |
