# 🚀 Getting Started with Perinola

Ready to spin up your team with Perinola? Here's how to get started in just a few steps.

> Perinola helps teams rotate responsibility, foster learning, and improve collaboration without heavy process overhead. Whether you're a startup, product squad, or dev team, it’s a fun, low-risk way to experiment with new team dynamics.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- **Team size**: 3-8 people (optimal: 4-6)
- **Commitment**: Willingness to try flexible roles
- **Mindset**: Open to collaboration and experimentation
- **Time**: 1-2 week iteration cycles

## 📋 Step 1: Team Preparation

### Introduce the Concept
- Share the [What is Perinola?](what-is-perinola.md) document
- Explain the six spins and their purposes
- Discuss how it differs from current practices

### Set Expectations
- Emphasize that everyone will try different roles
- Clarify that it's experimental and iterative
- Establish psychological safety for trying new things

## 🎲 Step 2: First Spin Session

### Choose Your Method
Pick how you'll determine spins:
- **Random**: Use a digital spinner or cards
- **Strategic**: Assign based on current needs
- **Hybrid**: Mix of both approaches

### Assign Initial Spins
Choose someone (e.g. team lead or previous “Take All”) to facilitate spin selection and explanation.
- Give everyone their first spin
- Explain what their specific spin means
- Set clear expectations for the iteration

## 🔄 Step 3: Run Your First Cycle

### Week Structure Example:

**Day 1-2: Kickoff (Everyone Puts)**
- Team planning session
- Define iteration goals
- Clarify individual spin responsibilities

**Day 3-8: Execution Phase**

- Regular check-ins and support
- Cross-collaboration as needed

**Day 9-10: Reflection & Sharing**
