# 🌀 Perinola Framework

*The revolutionary agile framework where "everyone puts in" (and everyone wins)*

Perinola is a game-changing collaborative work approach inspired by the famous Latin American spinning top game. Instead of rigid roles and eternal hierarchies, this framework literally revolves around the idea that all team members must participate, contribute, and take responsibility depending on the moment and need.

**Perfect for modern teams seeking dynamic collaboration, shared ownership, and breakthrough productivity.** Whether you're a tech team, a product squad, or a startup crew, Perinola adapts to your rhythm.

## 🎲 The Six Spins

Each spin represents a role your team members take during a work cycle, encouraging shared responsibility and rotation.

Each "spin" (or iteration) in Perinola can land on one of these key actions:

| Spin | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🤝 **Everyone Puts** | Collaborative session | All contribute ideas, work, or feedback |
| 🎯 **Take One** | Small task delegation | Quick, focused execution |
| 🚀 **Take Two** | Micro-project ownership | Expertise-driven features |
| 💡 **Put One** | Give back to team | Mentoring, documentation, support |
| 🔄 **Put Two** | Accountability moment | What are you returning to the community? |
| 👑 **Take All** | Full leadership | Own the entire iteration |

## 🎡 The Perinola Manifesto

*The framework where everyone spins, everyone contributes, and no one hides.*

### 🔁 Work rotates, purpose remains
No permanent heroes or eternal silos. Each person plays different roles to contribute from different angles. Rotation doesn't dilute commitment, it distributes it.

### 🧠 Collaborating is more important than leading
In Perinola, being "Take All" doesn't make you boss, and being "Put One" doesn't leave you out. Each spin is a type of responsibility. Everyone spins, everyone wins.

### 🙋 Effort visibility is part of the game
What you do counts, gets recognized, and gets shared. Value isn't measured only by deliverables, but by how you helped the team get there.

### ⚖️ Accountability means trust, not burden
Each spin has weight, but also limits. No one can be in "Take All" forever. We balance focus, energy, and real contributions.

### 🎯 No progress without pause
We close cycles with reflection. Retros aren't optional—they're where the framework grows. Changing roles also means changing perspective.

### 🧩 Structure supports, doesn't constrain
Perinola isn't a process, it's a dynamic. Adapt it, combine with other frameworks, hack it. As long as there's shared intention, there's Perinola.

### 🌱 Humor, honesty, and curiosity are pillars of serious work
We take work seriously, but don't let ego steal the fun. Asking, laughing, trying new things—that's also culture.

### ✊ Our commitment:
**Healthier, more connected, more adaptable teams.**  
Where each person has space to lead, support, learn, and rest.  
And where each cycle starts with a spin... and ends with something worthwhile.
