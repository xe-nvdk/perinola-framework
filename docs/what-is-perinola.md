# ðŸŒ€ What is Perinola?

Perinola is a collaborative work framework inspired by the traditional Latin American spinning top game. Just like the game where players take turns and the outcome determines their action, this framework creates dynamic, rotating responsibilities within teams.

It was created by Ignacio, a solutions architect and coach passionate about helping teams work better together. Perinola was born out of frustration with rigid frameworks and the desire to inject more humanity, play, and adaptability into team dynamics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Perinola was born as a response to overly rigid, hierarchical, and serious frameworks. It's designed for teams where:

- **Responsibilities move dynamically** - No one gets stuck in the same role forever
- **Genuine collaboration** is valued over individual protagonism  
- **Balance** between execution, learning, and ownership is sought
- **Team culture** matters as much as delivery
- **A human-centered approach** grounded in empathy, experimentation, and mutual support

Perinola combines the playful with the structured to foster healthy, agile, and adaptable teams.

## ðŸŽ² The Game Metaphor

Like the traditional spinning top game, each iteration involves a "spin" that determines the type of participation each person takes on. But unlike pure chance, Perinola spins can be:

- **Intentionally assigned** based on team needs
- **Rotated systematically** to ensure balance
- **Chosen randomly** for variety and surprise
- **Self-selected** based on individual capacity

## ðŸ”„ Core Principles

### ðŸŽ¡ Work rotates, but purpose remains
No one gets permanently stuck in any single role or responsibility.

### ðŸŽ¯ Every action has impact
No matter how small, each contribution matters to the team's success.

### ðŸ™Œ Collaboration is not optional
It's the heart of the framework - genuine teamwork over individual heroics.

### ðŸ¤¹ Flexible roles, constant commitment  
Roles change, but dedication to the team and goals stays consistent.

### ðŸ˜„ Humor is part of the methodology
Work should be engaging and enjoyable, not just productive.
